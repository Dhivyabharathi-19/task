    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <p>At ABC School, we offer a wide range of activities that promote learning beyond the classroom. From science fairs and debate competitions to cultural events and art workshops, students are encouraged to explore their interests and develop new skills. These activities help in building confidence, teamwork, and creativity among students.</p>

    <h3>Playing</h3>
    <p>We believe that physical activity is just as important as academics. Our school provides excellent sports facilities for games like football, basketball, cricket, and athletics. Through sports, students learn discipline, sportsmanship, and teamwork while maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. Regular inter-school tournaments and sports meets inspire students to perform at their best.</p>

    <h3>Social Service</h3>
    <p>ABC School is committed to instilling a sense of responsibility and compassion in students. Through various social service programs, such as community clean-ups, charity drives, and visits to old-age homes, students are encouraged to give back to society. These initiatives help students understand the importance of kindness, empathy, and making a positive impact on the world.</p>
