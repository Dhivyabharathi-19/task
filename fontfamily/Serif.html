    <h2>Chapter 1: The Lost Map</h2>
    <p>Evan brushed the dust off the ancient parchment. Underneath centuries of grime, he could just make out the faded lines — a map, leading deep into the heart of the Whispering Woods. Legends said no one who entered ever returned, but Evan wasn’t the type to run from a mystery.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
         <h2>Chapter 2: Into the Mist</h2>
         <p>The trees loomed overhead like silent sentinels. Each step Evan took seemed louder than the last. Around him, the mist coiled and danced, carrying faint echoes of laughter and sorrow. Somewhere in the distance, a bell tolled once... twice... and then fell silent.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Chapter 3: The Silver Key</h2>
    <p>Hidden beneath a hollowed-out stump, Evan found a small, silver key, cool to the touch. Inscribed along its shaft were words he couldn’t read — yet somehow understood. "Only the worthy may pass."</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Chapter 4: Shadows in the Water</h2>
        <p>
            By the moonlit river, shadows stirred. Evan caught glimpses of figures moving just out of sight. He gripped the key tighter, whispering a prayer he hadn't said since childhood. The water rippled, and a figure stepped forward — not entirely human.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Chapter 5: The Heart of the Realm</h2>
        <p>At last, Evan stood before the ancient gates. Ivy and stone twisted together, forming symbols that pulsed with a soft, blue light. The silver key grew warm in his hand. Beyond the gates, destiny — or doom — awaited.
